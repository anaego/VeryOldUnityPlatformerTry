# VeryOldUnityPlatformerTry
A looong time ago I tried to make a game just to see what it's like. This one is pretty awful, I had to cut out some badly-drawn cutscenes and a boring story :D Also contains a bug I can't seem to fix (maybe it's just because i've made this with some old version of unity) - the build doesn't seem to work correctly, but if you play it in unity itself, everything is fine. I think.
